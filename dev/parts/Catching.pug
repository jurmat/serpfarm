		.intro.Catching__intro No one knows how Google search functions, exactly. It is known, though, that it pays attention to links to your website, user behavior and relevance of your pageâ€™s content to the search query. If your page has text about buying an iPhone at a particular location, Google will think it is very relevant to a search request that mentions this place. Here is how you use this knowledge for profit:
		.subtitle.Catching__subtitle Create a website with a<br>new domain name
			.subtitle__text New domain names get promoted in search results.
		.subtitle.Catching__subtitle Write or buy an article with some<br>keywords that go well with<br>location data
			.subtitle__text For instance, it can be an article about car wash services in a specific location. Use an article spinning service to automatically generate tons of similar articles with slightly different wordings, as Google punishes websites for duplicate content.
		.subtitle.Catching__subtitle Use mass page generator software to create millions of pages for different locations
			.subtitle__text With a mass page generator like SERP.farm, you can do it in one second, and all the location data is already there. It is as easy as pressing a button.
		.subtitle.Catching__subtitle Wait for the website to get indexed and monetize your traffic
			.subtitle__text After your website gets indexed by Google, you will start getting tons of visitors to your website.<br><span>You can generate as many websites like this as you want!</span>
